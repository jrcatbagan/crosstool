The scripts in this directory with the exception of utility.sh are scripts specifically developed 
and tailored to build and configure a toolchain for a particular target.  The naming convention of 
the various configuration scripts indicate the target platform that the toolchain suite is being 
configured for.

The scripts configures a toolchain specifically targeting the target platform specified with 
parameters listed in the 'Target' section of each relevant script file.

The host platform that the toolchain will run on is determined by the -n/native or -c/--cross 
options.  Both options must not be specified at the same time.  The tool chain will be built on 
the platform that this script is invoked on and may not be the same as the host platform where the 
toolchain will eventually run.

In the context of the configuration scripts, the meaning of the options differ than what they are
normally referred to.  -n/--native specify that the toolchain will run on the platform that the
toolchain is built on.  On the other hand -c/--cross specify that the toolchain will run on the 
platform that the toolchain is targeting.  In other words, a native toolchain is being built for 
the target platform.  The option to configure an intermediary platform might be added in the future 
where a toolchain is built on the platform that this script is invoked on to run on a different 
architecture which in turn is targeting a different architecture as well.

The motivation in the approach of this script is to focus on building a toolchain specifically 
optimized for a specific target.  Consequently, this is not a general toolchain configuration.  
Furthermore, all platforms have different features and the toolchain associated with those 
individual platforms must be configured in a specific way in order to exploit those features.  
As the architectures that are involved increase over time, a specific configuration will be 
developed.
